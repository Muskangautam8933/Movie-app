# Movie App 🎬

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

The **Movie App** allows users to **search movies**, **view detailed information** (poster, director, genre, rating, etc.), and provides a **Download/Stream** link.  
It integrates with the [OMDb API](https://www.omdbapi.com/) to fetch movie details.
